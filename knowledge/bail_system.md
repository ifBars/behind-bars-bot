# Bail System Guide

## Overview

The bail system allows you to pay money to be released from jail immediately instead of serving your full sentence.

## How Bail Works

1. **After Arrest**: Your bail amount is automatically calculated
2. **Bail Calculation**: 
   - Base amount is **2.5x your fine amount**
   - Adjusted based on your player level and status
   - Higher-level players pay more
3. **Payment Options**: 
   - Pay the full bail amount yourself
   - Have friends pay for you in multiplayer (if enabled)

## Bail Amount Scaling

Bail amounts scale significantly with your player rank:
- **Street Rat**: 1.0x multiplier
- **Hoodlum**: 1.2x multiplier
- **Peddler**: 1.5x multiplier
- **Hustler**: 1.8x multiplier
- **Bagman**: 2.0x multiplier
- **Enforcer**: 2.5x multiplier
- **Shot Caller**: 3.0x multiplier
- **Block Boss**: 3.5x multiplier
- **Underlord**: 4.0x multiplier
- **Baron**: 4.5x multiplier
- **Kingpin**: 5.0x multiplier
