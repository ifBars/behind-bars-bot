# Parole System Guide

## Overview

After serving jail time, you may be placed on parole. During parole, you're monitored by parole officers and must avoid violations.

## When Parole Starts

- **Currently**: Parole starts automatically after every jail release
- **Future Update**: Parole will only start after multiple arrests (this is planned for a future update)
- You'll see a Parole Conditions UI when released
- Your parole period is tracked in game time

## LSI Risk Assessment

The Level of Service Inventory (LSI) system determines your supervision level:

### Minimum Risk
- **Search Chance**: 10%
- **Supervision**: Low
- **Detection Range**: Smaller radius
- **Best for**: First-time offenders with minor crimes

### Medium Risk
- **Search Chance**: 30%
- **Supervision**: Moderate
- **Detection Range**: Medium radius
- **Best for**: Repeat offenders with moderate history

### High Risk
- **Search Chance**: 50%
- **Supervision**: Intensive
- **Detection Range**: Larger radius
- **Best for**: Serious repeat offenders

### Severe Risk
- **Search Chance**: 70%
- **Supervision**: Maximum
- **Detection Range**: Largest radius (up to 40m)
- **Best for**: Most dangerous offenders

## Parole Officers

Two types of parole officers monitor you:

### Supervising Officers
- Stationary officers at police stations
- Monitor parole compliance
- Handle violations

### Patrol Officers
- Officers patrolling city areas
- Patrol routes in: Uptown, Westside, Docks, Northtown
- Conduct random contraband searches

## Random Searches

Parole officers can search you for contraband:

### Search Mechanics
- **Detection Range**: Varies by LSI level (17m-40m)
- **Search Cooldown**: Minimum 2 minutes between searches
- **Grace Period**: 30 minutes after release before searches begin
- **Search Probability**: Based on your LSI level

### What Happens During a Search
1. Officer approaches you
2. You're instructed to stop
3. Officer searches your inventory
4. If contraband is found, you're in violation

## Parole Violations

### Types of Violations
- **Contraband Possession**: Having illegal items
- **Other Infractions**: Various parole rule violations

### Violation Consequences
- **Extended Parole**: Your parole period is extended

- **Possible Re-Arrest**: Serious violations may result in immediate arrest

## Parole Status UI

The Parole Status UI shows:
- **Time Remaining**: How much parole time is left
- **LSI Level**: Your current risk assessment
- **Search Probability**: Your chance of being searched
- **Violation Count**: Number of violations you've committed

## Parole Conditions UI

When released, you'll see:
- **Parole Duration**: How long you'll be on parole
